I am an assistant professor in the [CSE Department](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) at [Pennsylvania State University--University Park](https://www.psu.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Institute for Computational and Data Sciences](https://www.icds.psu.edu/about/meet-the-icds-team/directory/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the EECS department at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I received my Ph.D. degree from the computer science department at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs). 

My research focuses on deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing, particularly in the area of action understanding in the video. The goal of my research is building robust action understanding algorithms with human-level structural knowledge and efficient multi-modal supervision. To achieve this goal, my research touches the following two aspects: compositional action recognition with knowledge reasoning, and multi-modal action detection with less supervision.

**Prospective students**: We have openings for Ph.D. students and visiting scholars with backgrounds in computer vision, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics or computer graphics. Interested candidates can send your CV and transcripts to [hkx5063@psu.edu](hkx5063@psu.edu)














Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
